# gearfaultdesc
a data science project I had to do recently. 

#for the full raw file - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hieudaotrung/gear-vibration
we took 1000 values of each label from the above dataset 
we take in inputs (sensor values, time values, speed set values) and predict which gear fault they fall into. 
this is a pretty basic code and i did it for the funsies 

#could be expanded into something useful in the future?
